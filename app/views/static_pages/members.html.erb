                Hi my name is Ju Kim and I am one of the founders of FTP Ventures LLC. Coming in with an economics/tech management education background, I'm hoping to contribute market analysis of our investment properties. growing up I believed that the 9-5 lifestyle was the only way to succeed. I went to college, did my time, and have now started a full time job. After working for a while, I've come to realize that there was a way to generate multiple streams of income without having to go through the traditional route.
            </p>

            <p class="card-text">
                Through life's tribulations I want to make more of myself than sitting at a desk for 8 hours a day. Though this route of entrepreneurship may have its rough days, I believe in my abilities as well as my co-founders' abilities to make this company into a success story. By revolutionizing investment methods, I hope to bring my ideas to fruition, and turn not just my dreams, but the dreams' of our investors into a story of success.

                With a background in criminal justice, I am currently on my third year as a Customs and Border Protection officer. Now that my career has a strong foundation, Iâ€™ve began to learn and dive deeper into my other interests, which are real estate and the stock market.
            </p>

            <p class="card-text">
                Aside from these interests, my passion has always been in health and fitness so I make that a priority even with my long working hours. Lifting has not only taught me perseverance, persistence, and patience, but humility as well. I am excited and motivated to see what this real estate venture holds for us.
